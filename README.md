## Reference

For more detailed code examples take a look into the example app

### Twitter

#### Social.isTwitterSupported()
Returns *true* or *false*.  
false if no account has been defined (true in the 6.0 simulator) or the iOS Version doesn't support the Social Framework.

#### Social.twitter(*{Object} options*)
`options` can have the following keys:

* *text* - the status message
* *image* - a local/remote path to an image you want to share
* *url* - a url you want to share

Each of these options is optional

#### Social.twitterRequest(*{Object} options [, {Object} requestParameter]*)
`options`has the following keys:

* *requestType* - can be *GET*, *POST* or *DELETE*
* *url* - the url you want to request
* *callbackEvent* - optional - default: *facebookRequest* - how is the event called that is fired after request has succeeded?

`requestParameter` is optional, but is build like this:

	{
		'screen_name': 'C_BHole'
	}

So *screen_name* is the parameter name / key and *C_BHole* is the value of the parameter

### Facebook

#### Social.isFacebookSupported()
Returns *true* or *false*.  
false if no account has been defined (true in the 6.0 simulator) or the iOS Version doesn't support the Social Framework.

#### Social.facebook(*{Object} options*)
`options` can have the following keys:

* *text* - the status message
* *image* - a local/remote path to an image you want to share
* *url* - a url you want to share

Each of these options is optional

#### Social.facebookRequest(*{Object} options [, {Object} requestParameter]*)
`options` has the following keys:

* *requestType* - can be *GET*, *POST* or *DELETE*
* *url* - the url you want to request
* *appIdKey* - the appid of your facebook app
* *permissionsKey* - optional - a comma seperated string that contains the required permissions
* *callbackEvent* - optional - default: *facebookRequest* - how is the event called that is fired after request has succeeded?

`requestParameter` is optional, but is build like this:

	{
		fields: 'id,name,devices'
	}

So *fields* is the parameter name / key and *id,name,devices* is the value of the parameter

### Sina Weibo

Returns *true* or *false*.  
false if no account has been defined (true in the 6.0 simulator) or the iOS Version doesn't support the Social Framework.

`options` can have the following keys:

* *text* - the status message

* *removeIcons* - customise the dialog by removing unwanted icons.


## Example of usage

#### FollowMe Button

It takes an account the os version and for iOS 5 will try to open the profile page in another application that exits on the device.

Please check the *Example* section in the file.
